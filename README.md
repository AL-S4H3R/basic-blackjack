# An attempt at implementing basic features of BlackJack.(aka 21).
Used the deck of cards api: http://deckofcardsapi.com/ for all the card actions: Setting up a new game, player hits/stands and the consequent games.
Used ReactJs for frontend and TailwindCSS for designing the basic UI.

Each game is tracked using a "deck_id", which is tracked using the localStorage.
Built for MLH Hackday.

#Features to be implemented in the newer versions:
1) User Authentication.
2) Complete blackjack (US implementation) with double-down, splitting decks, tracking game history, and setting up a win amount.
3) Play BlackJack with friends using a game room.
4) In-game Chat.
